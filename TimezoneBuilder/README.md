Ultibo Timezone Builder tool

This is the source for the Ultibo Timezone Builder used to create the TimezoneList in the Timezone unit.

The tool reads all available timezones from the registry on the local computer and converts them to a TTimezoneList structure to be copied and pasted directly into the timezone unit.


Compiled with Delphi (Convertible to FPC/Lazarus)
